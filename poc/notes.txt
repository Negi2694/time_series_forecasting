Time Series Forecasting comes under quantitative forecasting.

Time Series Data Components:
    Level
    Trend
    Seasonality
    Cyclicity
    Noise

Smoothing Technique:
    Clearing out random noise and eliminating outliers to see patterns & trends.
    Helps in studying all the components independently.

Handling NULL values:
    Mean/Median Imputation
    Last Observation Carried Formward
    Next Observation Carried Backward
    Linear Interpolation
    Seasonal Linear Interpolation

Outliers:
    Deteching Outliers
        Extreme Value analysis
        Using Boxplot
        Using Histogram
    Handling Outliers
        Replacing the value with Mean, Median or Mode
        Trimming that record
        Lower and Higher end-capping
        Zero Capping

Two Methods to Extract(Decmpose) Components from The Time Series Data
    Additive Seasonal Component
    Multiplicative Seasonal Component

Stationary Series
    A series without a trend or seasonal components.
    A series whose mean, variance, covarience & standard deviation are not a function of time.
